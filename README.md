# Password_Generator
A JavaScript, HTML and CSS code based application that randomly generates a password for the user.

## About the project
I have written some code predominatly in JavaScript, with HTML and CSS elements, to create a random password
generation application for users. The application allows users to select the following parameters for their 
password - number of characters, and whether to include uppercase, lowercase, numeric and/ or special characters.
The applciation prompts the users for this information, and ensures the users can only choose a password length
between 10 and 64 characters. If the user enters an incorrect value/ input, or does not choose an characters, an error is returned and the user is asked to enter the information again.

This application allows a user to quickly randomly generate a password by selecting only the five aforementiond parameters.
